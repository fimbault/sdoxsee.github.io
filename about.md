        Stephen has over 15 years of software engineering experience. He's worked with organizations from large to small across diverse sectors including finance, healthcare, insurance, and not-for-profit. He established <a href="https://simplestep.ca">Simple Step Solutions</a> in 2014 as an independent software contracting business. His customers began adopting architectures with Single Page Applications, internal and external facing APIs, and Single Sign-On with partner organizations. As a result, he found himself digging into OAuth2/OIDC specifications and deep-diving into best-practices and architectures that work well with Identity and Access Management. Stephen has been using the Spring Framework since 2008 and has contributed to open source projects like JHipster, Spring Security and Spring Boot.
