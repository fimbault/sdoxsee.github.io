# Preamble on architecture

There are different opinions on whether or not to keep the UI separate from the backend API. 

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">I write a lot of Java API + JavaScript App tutorials. If youâ€™ve read them, thanks! <br><br>Iâ€™m curious to know which deployment model you prefer. Results may influence future tutorials/talks. ðŸ˜‰<br><br>Do you prefer:</p>&mdash; Matt Raible (@mraible) <a href="https://twitter.com/mraible/status/1032353786713391104?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 22, 2018</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

At face value, it looks like people like them to be separated. However, I think the question needs more unpacking (Dave Syer does a great job of [discussing](https://spring.io/guides/tutorials/spring-security-and-angular-js/#_help_how_is_my_application_going_to_scale) this). 

My take on that poll is that people don't want to restart their backend to see changes in their UI code. I 100% agree with that. However, you can still have that developer experience and serve up the UI along with a backend of some sort. In the case of a monolith, your full backend API would be part of your bundle. In the case of a microservice gateway, you can still serve up your application with a thin server-side gateway that manages your authentication, session, OAuth2 access tokens, and request routing. That's what we're going to do in this tutorial. Devs may also be worried about fighting with UI and server configuration when serving up the UI along with a backend but I'll show you how easy it is!

This tutorial builds on the great work of others. Tania Rascia has a simple standalone CRUD front-end built with Create React App and Hooks https://github.com/taniarascia/react-hooks. I love it because it's simple! However, as a good Java developer, we have to add TypeScript and, until I learn [Styled Components](https://www.styled-components.com/), my go-to UI style is Bootstrap with Reactstrap. We also add some OpenID Connect Authentication by using some techniques by Matt Raible in [Use React and Spring Boot to Build a Simple CRUD App](https://developer.okta.com/blog/2018/07/19/simple-crud-react-and-spring-boot) and make the backend a Spring Cloud Gateway (Webflux) and OAuth2 Client.

# Generate the project

## Server side
Let's go to [start.spring.io](https://start.spring.io/#!type=maven-project&language=java&platformVersion=2.2.2.RELEASE&packaging=jar&jvmVersion=1.8&groupId=ca.simplestep&artifactId=gateway&name=gateway&description=Demo%20project%20for%20Spring%20Boot&packageName=ca.simplestep.gateway&dependencies=cloud-gateway,oauth2-client,security) and generate our gateway.zip

Dependencies? `cloud-gateway,oauth2-client,security`

![start.spring.io](/assets/images/merry-microservices/part2/gateway.start.spring.io.png)

## Front end
Make sure you have [node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed. I've got `v10.16.3` but the current LTS (`v12.x`) should work fine. My npm is `6.0.0`.

Put your gateway.zip file where you want your combined UI and Gateway code to live. Then unzip it and create your react app

{% highlight bash %}
unzip gateway.zip && mkdir gateway/src/main && cd gateway/src/main && npx create-react-app app --template typescript && cd app && npm start
{% endhighlight %}

We should see a simple react app on http://localhost:3000

Next, add [reactstrap](https://reactstrap.github.io/) dependencies

{% highlight bash %}
npm install --save bootstrap
npm install --save reactstrap react react-dom
npm install --save @types/reactstrap
{% endhighlight %}

The `@types/reactstrap` is so that TypeScript knows the types needed for Reactstrap components.
{: .notice}

Now we can import it to our `src/index.tsx`

{% highlight javascript %}
import 'bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css';
{% endhighlight %}

I won't go through all the details of how convert Tania Rascia's CRUD example into TypeScript and Reactstrap, but that's what I did. 

For TypeScript, I basically, copied the `.js` files, converted them to `.tsx`, added types to make errors go away. I create a common `Note.tsx` that could be used to represent notes in the different files.

{% highlight typescript %}
export interface Note {
  id: number;
  text: string;
  confidential: boolean;
}
{% endhighlight %}

For Reactstrap, I just changed things like `<input>` to Reactstrap's `<Input>` and so on :)

In the end I had a working CRUD app running on `http://localhost:3000` but the state was all stored in the browser and, of course, there was no authentication or access tokens with which we could call a secured backend.

At this point I leaned on Matt Raible's React example to call a yet-to-be-implemented `/api/user` endpoint that returns either an empty string or the username (if authenticated) but with Hooks!

In `App.tsx`, I did the following:

```
const App = () => {
  // ...

  // Setting state
  const [ isAuthenticated, setAuthenticated ] = useState(false)
  const [ authenticatedUser, setAuthenticatedUser ] = useState('')
  const [ cookies ] = useCookies(['XSRF-TOKEN'])

  useEffect(() => {
    // Create a scoped async function in the hook
    async function runAsync() {
      try {
        const response = await fetch('/api/user');
        const body = await response.text();
        
        if (body === '') {
          setAuthenticated(false)
          setAuthenticatedUser('')
        } else {
          setAuthenticated(true)
          setAuthenticatedUser(body)
        }
      } catch {
        // add better error handling here
      }
    }
    // Execute the created function directly
    runAsync()
  }, []);
  
  // ...
}
```

Since our `/api/user` call is async, we put it in an `async` function, `runAsync`, and invoke it with `runAsync()` after defining it. Once we get the body of our response we'll know if we have a authenticated user or not by whether the body (i.e. the username) is an empty string or not. Depending on whether or not we have a username come back, we set the state accordingly. As for the `const [ cookies ] = useCookies(['XSRF-TOKEN'])`, we'll get to that in a minute :)

# Authentication and Security

Next we want to hide the UI if we are not authenticated and show a login or logout button depending if the value of `isAuthenticated` is `false` or `true` respectively

```
const App = () => {
  // ...
  const login = () => {
    let port = (window.location.port ? ':' + window.location.port : '');
    window.location.href = '//' + window.location.hostname + port + '/private';
  }

  return (
    <Container>
      <Jumbotron>
        <h1>CRUD App with Hooks</h1>
        {isAuthenticated ?
        <Form action="/logout" method="POST">
          <Input type="hidden" name="_csrf" value={cookies['XSRF-TOKEN']}/>
          <h3>Welcome {authenticatedUser}!</h3><Button color="secondary">Logout</Button>
        </Form> :
        <Button onClick={login}>Login</Button>
        }
      </Jumbotron>
      {isAuthenticated &&
      <Row>
      <!-- ... -->
      </Row>
      }
    </Container>    
  )
}
```

In the above tsx code, we define a `login` function that, when we click the login button, we get redirected to `/private`. The purpose of this is to hit a secured server-side endpoint that will force authentication with the configured Identity Provider, Keycloak in our case. For our logout button, we put it in a form that submits a `POST` to `/logout` and include a hidden input named `_csrf` with the value from a cookie named `XSRF_TOKEN`. We're now getting to the point where we need to jump to the server-side to understand what's going on. 

## YAML OAuth2 configuration

How does Spring Security know to redirect us to Keycloak? Well, we tell set it up with an OAuth2 client registration. Here's a part of our `src/main/resources/application.yml`:

{% highlight yaml %}
# ...
spring:
  security:
    oauth2:
      client:
        registration:
          login-client:
            provider: keycloak
            client-id: web_app
            client-secret: web_app
            scope: openid,profile,email
        provider:
          keycloak:
            issuer-uri: http://localhost:9080/auth/realms/jhipster
# ...
{% endhighlight %}

Above we define a `provider` that we call `keycloak` whose meta information (i.e. endpoints, supported features, etc.) can be found at the `issuer-uri`. It's called the `discovery endpoint` and, once Keycloak has started up, you can check it out yourself at [http://localhost:9080/auth/realms/jhipster/.well-known/openid-configuration](http://localhost:9080/auth/realms/jhipster/.well-known/openid-configuration).

In the `registration` section, we name our client `login-client` and link it to our `keycloak` provider. Out Keycloak realm has been pre-setup with a client that has the client id `web_app` and client secret `web_app`. Of course you'll change the client secret in your hosted environments! Finally, we request three scopes `openid,profile,email` so that Keycloak will allow us to get user information and, most importantly, an `id_token` AND an `access_token` for authentication and authorization respectively.

## Spring Security configuration

Once we've added the YAML configuration, we need to customize our `SecurityWebFilterChain` to cause Spring Boot's otherwise-autoconfigured one to back off. 

{% highlight java %}
@EnableWebFluxSecurity
class SecurityConfiguration {

  // ...

  @Bean
  public SecurityWebFilterChain securityWebFilterChain(ServerHttpSecurity http) {
    http
        .oauth2Login(withDefaults())
        .csrf(csrf -> csrf.csrfTokenRepository(CookieServerCsrfTokenRepository.withHttpOnlyFalse()))
        .authorizeExchange(exchanges ->
            exchanges
                .pathMatchers("/manifest.json", "/*.png", "/static/**", "/api/user", "/").permitAll()
                .anyExchange().authenticated()
        )
        .logout(logout ->
            logout
                .logoutSuccessHandler(oidcLogoutSuccessHandler()));
    return http.build();
  }

  private ServerLogoutSuccessHandler oidcLogoutSuccessHandler() {
    OidcClientInitiatedServerLogoutSuccessHandler oidcLogoutSuccessHandler =
        new OidcClientInitiatedServerLogoutSuccessHandler(this.clientRegistrationRepository) {
          @Override
          public Mono<Void> onLogoutSuccess(WebFilterExchange exchange, Authentication authentication) {
            // https://stackoverflow.com/q/15988323/1098564
            // logout was called and proxied, let's default redirection to "origin"
            List<String> origin = exchange.getExchange().getRequest().getHeaders().get(HttpHeaders.ORIGIN);
            // https://stackoverflow.com/q/22397072/1098564
            setPostLogoutRedirectUri(URI.create(origin.isEmpty() || "null".equals(origin.get(0)) ?
                "http://localhost:" + serverPort :
                origin.get(0)));
            return super.onLogoutSuccess(exchange, authentication);
          }
        };
    return oidcLogoutSuccessHandler;
  }
}
{% endhighlight %}

There's a fair bit going on above.

* `oauth2Login` tells us to redirect the browser to the Keycloak's authorization endpoint for the user to authenticate there. Before it redirects, it will save the request (e.g. `/private`) and redirect the browser back there once the user is authenticated.
* We configure `csrf` with `CookieServerCsrfTokenRepository.withHttpOnlyFalse()` so that the React app will be able to obtain the `XSRF-TOKEN` that Spring Security will return in responses so that it can send it with `POST` requests.
* We configure the `authorizeExchange` to ensure all requests are made by an authenticated user except for requests to known public paths:
  * `/manifest.json` created by Create React App
  * `/*.png` created by Create React App
  * `/static/**` where we copy the build directory following an `npm build` from Create React App
  * `/api/user` where we return a username if the user is authenticated, and
  * `/` to let the `index.html` with our login button display without triggering a Keycloak redirection
* Finally, we configure `logout`. We'll take the following paragraph to explain that one.

We configure `logout` with an `OidcClientInitiatedServerLogoutSuccessHandler` that knows about the Identity Provider's `end_session_endpoint` and will log us out of both our gateway AND Keycloak--redirecting us back, unauthenticated, to our application's `/`. Since we won't always be on `localhost`, our Identity Provider usually needs to redirect us back to a different DNS name or port. When we're running our UI with `npm start`, we want to be redirected back to `http://localhost:3000`. When we're running in production, our application may be running on port 8080 but we're usually behind a reverse proxy with a DNS like `https://gateway.simplestep.ca` that we want to be redirected back to. In both cases, there's a proxy involved so that, by the time we get to our server-side, the request URI has changed. Fortunately, the `origin` http header is set with the original host where the `POST` to `/logout` was requested, letting us set that as our `post_logout_redirect_uri` when we're logged out (e.g. `http://localhost:3000` or `https://gateway.simplestep.ca`)

# Honour proxy's x-forward header in webflux

Next, lets jump back to our `application.yml` for a second...

{% highlight yaml %}
server:
  forward-headers-strategy: framework # https://stackoverflow.com/a/59126519/1098564 (but ours is non-servlet)
{% endhighlight %}

This tells Spring to look for `x-forward-*` headers set by the proxy to let the requests be understood on the application server as if they were made to the proxy server itself. This must be done in on your nginx or whatever proxy server you use. For local development, we also have a proxy server--a node.js express app running on `http://localhost:3000`. We can add in some middleware to configure it beyond the Create React App proxy defaults.

# Add express proxy configuration to proxy to our gateway server
So, we install `http-proxy-middleware`

{% highlight bash %}
npm install --save http-proxy-middleware
{% endhighlight %}

and then we add `setupProxy.js` with the following content:

{% highlight javascript %}
// https://create-react-app.dev/docs/proxying-api-requests-in-development#configuring-the-proxy-manually
// https://github.com/chimurai/http-proxy-middleware
const proxy = require('http-proxy-middleware');
module.exports = function(app) {
  app.use(
    [
        '/api',
        '/logout',
        '/private',
        '/oauth2/authorization/login-client',
        '/login/oauth2/code/login-client'
    ],
    proxy({
      target: 'http://localhost:8080',
      changeOrigin: true,
      xfwd: true,
    })
  );
};
{% endhighlight %}

Here we add the `xfwd: true` to our proxy options so that `x-forward-*` headers are added. 

Of course, we'll be proxying to `http://localhost:8080` where our gateway server is running.

We also say that we want to proxy any requests made to the following paths to our gateway backend:
* `/api` so we receive requests like `/api/notes`
* `/logout` so that our form post will be received
* `/private` so that when we redirect to `/private` that Spring Security can redirect it again for authentication at the Identity Provider
* `/oauth2/authorization/login-client` because Spring Security's redirection to the Identity Provider first gets redirected here to make call the authorize endpoint for this particular client. In this case, `login-client`.
* and finally, `/login/oauth2/code/login-client` because that is where the Identity Provider sends back the `code` during the OAuth2 authorization_code dance.

# Start keycloak
Well, we've done a lot of configuration to talk to our Identity Provider so let's start it, Keycloak, up!

{% highlight bash %}
docker-compose -f src/main/docker/keycloak.yml up -d
{% endhighlight %}

Verify it's running at `http://localhost:9080`

# Set up our server-side routes
From our React UI, we redirect to `/private` when the login button is clicked. Of course we don't want to end up there--we're doing it to trigger authentication. Let's define our routes and some handlers for those routes

{% highlight java %}
@Configuration
class WebConfig implements WebFluxConfigurer {

  @Bean
  RouterFunction<ServerResponse> routerFunction(GatewayHandler gatewayHandler) {
    return route(GET("/api/user"), gatewayHandler::getCurrentUser)
        .andRoute(GET("/private"), gatewayHandler::getPrivate);
  }

  // see https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-security/issues/5766#issuecomment-564636167
  @Bean
  WebFilter addCsrfToken() {
    return (exchange, next) -> exchange
        .<Mono<CsrfToken>>getAttribute(CsrfToken.class.getName())
        .doOnSuccess(token -> {})
        .then(next.filter(exchange));
  }
}

@Component
class GatewayHandler {

	public Mono<ServerResponse> getCurrentUser(ServerRequest request) {
		return request.principal()
				.map(p -> ((OAuth2AuthenticationToken)p).getPrincipal())
				.flatMap(n -> ok().bodyValue(n.getAttribute("preferred_username")));
	}

	public Mono<ServerResponse> getPrivate(ServerRequest serverRequest) {
		return ServerResponse.temporaryRedirect(URI.create("/")).build();
	}
}
{% endhighlight %}

We've got two routes and their respective handler methods:
1. `/api/user` where we get the current username from the ID Token's `preferred_username` claim that is set in our `OAuth2AuthenticationToken`, and
2. `/private` where we return a redirect back to our root, `/` because, like we said, we only did this to trigger authentication.
Add RouterFunction and Handler to server (user and private)
Add proxy
Honour proxy in x-forward header in webflux
Add logouthandler (including port)
CSRF token
Post to logout
Add Predicate to relay token to resource server
Tweak functions to actually call backend api. Then just get all notes again
Add call to get all notes
Add front-end-plugin to pom.xml for prod
Try it out on 8080
Add index.html to / mapping
